When calling setState to increment the counter, should the parameter be a function or an object? Why?

ANSWER: -the parameter should be a function. 
This because by passing it a callback,
this call is not made synchronously, 
so that you canalways have a fresh value of the state.
||can receives the current state and return the new state||
