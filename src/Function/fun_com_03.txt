What happens if the numbers prop of the Sum component is not set? How can you set a default value for this prop?

ANSWER: if num is unset the value returned is undefined and return an error:
 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reduce')';
 Could set a default value instead of props by writing something like:
  ({num=[1, 2, 3, 4]}),
